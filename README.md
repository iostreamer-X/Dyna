# Dyna
Linux Virtual Assistant

A basic virtual assistant powered by http://Wit.ai.

Dyna supports searching stuff on google, playing videos on youtube, volume & brightness control.
All you need to do is, say the right words. For example, saying "play lean on Major lazer" would fire up your browser
with the tune.
